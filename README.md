## Project Overview
Dana would like to enhance her website to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The increased functionality of the table filters allows users to get specific in locating a UFO sighting or obtain data specific to a  multiple location parameters, shape of sighting, or a combination of filters. The additional filters allows users more control in filtering, thus helping to possibly identify patters or trends in data.

# Summary
One drawback of this design is the lack of a filter button. Two recommendations I would make is to add the following events/buttons for added convenience:
-"Filter Table" button
-"Reset Table" Button.
